# 510-MiniProject2
This is a repository for my second mini-project in Math 510: Linear Programming, taught by Henry Adams.

In this repository, you can find 2 files: "1-Wasserstein-dis.ipynb" and "LinearProgrammingCrossword.pdf".

In "1-Wasserstein-dis.ipynb", I describe the problem of finding the 1-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams when viewed as measures supported on the upper-half plane (indeed, "optimal partial transport" is perhaps a better phrase than 1-Wasserstein distance, but I address that in the file).
Then, we use linear programming to actually compute the 1-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams on samples of shapes.

Packages necessary to run the code:
* NumPy 
* SciPy
* Ripser
* Teaspoon
* MatPlotLib
* Persim

"LinearProgrammingCrossword.pdf" constains (no surprise) a lienar progamming themed crossword puzzle! Of course, not every clue is linear programming theme (one may be very related to my pesonal life, oof)... But hopefully it is fun to try out!
